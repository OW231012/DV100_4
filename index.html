                then the image then also sizes up and down depending on the size of the screen of the device you are viewing the browser 
                on. If you want the image to only be half the size of the screen use 50%, etc.-->

                it that it should just be a normal click button'. The ID="bluebutton" is for when you use CSS to make everything pretty, 
                and this one button should be different from the rest you give it an ID tag. An ID tag can only be used once for one 
            specific element. If you need multiple elements to have the same "ID" you need to use a class tag instead of an ID tag.-->
